Ideas

a) Software Engineering
- move code responsible for creating best model to Python project
- divide code into modules
- code is function ready so it can be additionally tested for stability
- provide simple api that will allow to use model thorugh commandline

b) Preprocessing / Data Cleaning
- different tokenization pattern for vectorizers - I would like to perserving characters as words and play with ngrams
- try removing digits from dictionary

c) Model Optimization
- I would like to add hyperopt instead of GridSearch

d) Algorithms
- I would like to try ExtraTrees
- I would like to try Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron) e.g. KerasClassifier of Sklearn, I didn't have time to implement them

e) Architecture
- would like to add learning_curves, I prefer them more for monitoring overfitting
- different train_predict variant for Neural Networks

f) Other
- model stacking on models that were doing worse on Python and better on Mathematica
- I would like to get more data from web
- preview code of misclassified files, maybe there is an issue I haven't spotted
- Mathemtaica class needs more analysis, models have trouble with it
